Hide potential spoilers from your new favourite tv shows with this simple plugin

---

### What does this do?

This plugin censors the number of times an actors appears in any TV show. To un-censor this information, simply mouse-over the hidden field.

### Why would you want to do this?

Knowing the number of episodes an actor appears in can indirectly reveal significant spoilers. If you're behind on a TV show and see that a character only appears in 10 of the 60 episodes aired, it's safe to say that they have been killed-off or otherwise written out of the show.
